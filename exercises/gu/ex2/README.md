This program uses the Barnes-Hut algorithm (stored in `tree.f90`) to perform an N-body simulation with the particles generated by `particulas.f90` and stored in a file called `initial_conditions.dat`. The output is stored in the `output.dat` file, which is structured as: t x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 ... xn yn zn.

The program can be compiled with and without parallelizing by (un)commenting (with #) the -fopenmp flag in the `makefile`.

# Timed tests:
These tests were made in the CCA machines, which have 6 cores.

For 10 particles, 1k steps:
- no parallel: 2.4E-02 seconds
- parallel: 2.8E-02 seconds

For 100 particles, 1k steps:
- no parallel: 0.7 seconds
- parallel: 0.3 seconds

For 1000 particles, 1k steps:
- no parallel: 20.2 seconds
- parallel: 5.2 seconds

For 10 particles the parallelized version is slower than the non-parallelized version. This was expected as the benefit from parallelizing is negligible compared to its cost. For the other tests, we see parallelizing the code consistently makes the code run faster.
